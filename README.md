# GUCACL23LearningSystem
Repo for the project for Winter 2022 GUC ACL the Online Learning System project

Hello! This is the first touchstone for the development of the "Fe ACL Fel Beit" group in the Winter 2022 ACL Project
The idea of the project, as revealed by the TA Nada Ibrahim so far, is to build an online learning system using the MERN stack.
Technologies to use in the project:
    MongoDB
    Express.js
    NodeJS
    React - React Bootstrap

Learn these techs guys, lets get this going!
Also, in the future, we'll split tasks and everyone start making their own branches then making pull requests to "Development" so we can review the work together.
